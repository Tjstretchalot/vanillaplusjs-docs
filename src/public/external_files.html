            <p>
                Many projects are built on top of existing libraries, such as
                <a class="link-button" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> or
                <a class="link-button" href="https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/#cdn">Material
                    UI</a>
                which offer distribution via a CDN. However, serving the files
                from the CDN is not usually the best option - it would require a
                less strict Content Security Policy and
                <a class="link-button" href="https://www.peakhour.io/blog/cache-partitioning-firefox-chrome/">no longer
                    benefits from a shared cache.</a> Hence it's better to serve the files
                directly from your own server in the same manner you distribute your other
                static assets.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, ease of deployment is a big concern, since nearly every web project
                is a good target for <a class="link-button" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD">continuous
                    integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)</a>. Hence one might be tempted to
                actually store these external files in their own repository. This is definitely
                simple from a CI/CD perspective, but makes versioning a pain and leads to spuriously
                large commits and repositories.
            </p>
            <p>
                To avoid this issue, Vanilla Plus JS can be configured to have source code files
                downloaded if they do not exist. After downloading they will go through
                standard processing &ndash; which will also make them CSP-friendly, even if they
                otherwise might not be. For example, the inline SVGs in many minified CSS files will
                be outlined for you. The following is an example of how to configure
                <code class="text-monospace">vanillaplusjs.json</code> to download (or update) bootstrap
                if it's not available (or is out of date). Note that the parts of the
                configuration not related to external files are not shown.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="text-monospace">{
    "external_files": {
        "src/public/css/lib/bootstrap.min.css": {
