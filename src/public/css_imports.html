            <p>
                Although <a class="link-button"
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS custom
                    properties</a>
                significantly reduce the need for general CSS preprocessing, there are
                still a handful of circumstances where there is a lot of style repetition
                due to the lack of inheritance support. In particular, unstyling buttons and
                focus states to have the same appearance on all browsers is quite repetitive,
                and typography can have multiple parts (e.g.,
                <code class="text-monospace">font-family</code> and <code class="text-monospace">font-size</code>)
                which makes custom properties less useful.
            </p>

            <p>
                Vanilla Plus JS provides a preprocessor command to include the directives within a different
                <a class="link-button" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#qualified-rule">qualified rule</a>
                into the current one. This does not create additional declarations and thus the
                rules prelude must be specified exactly. It will not copy over additional
                styles if the rule is overriden in various at-rules - it will only take the
                top-level qualified rule matching the given prelude. The behavior is <strong>undefined</strong>
                when multiple matching top-level qualified rules exist - for performance, the
                imported file may be in any state of parsing after completely determining the
                first matching top-level qualified rule, and hence, Vanilla Plus JS may not
                behave consistently.
            </p>

            <p>
                Imports will come from the default CSS file (typically
                <code class="text-monospace">src/public/css/main.css</code>) unless
                otherwise indicated. Here is an example that would work within the
                default CSS file:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="text-monospace">.text-body-1 {
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
    font-size: 1.125rem;
    line-height: 1.5;
}

p {
    /*! PREPROCESSOR: import .text-body-1 */
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                The above example would be equivalent to:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="text-monospace">.text-body-1 {
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
    font-size: 1.125rem;
    line-height: 1.5;
}

p {
    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;
    font-size: 1.125rem;
    line-height: 1.5;
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                The file to import from can be specified in the preprocessor directive:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="text-monospace">p {
    /*! PREPROCESSOR: import .text-body-1 FROM /css/typography.css */
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                Where the file is specified relative to the <code class="text-monospace">src/public</code>
                directory. You may reference rules within the same file before they are
                declared, and you may reference rules within another file, but you cannot
                cause circular file dependencies or circular rule dependencies. Build times
                are improved by having more commonly imported styles near the top of the
                file in the order they are needed, though this is rarely an issue if file
                sizes are kept reasonable.
            </p>

                This is related to but not quite the same as nesting support, which you
                can follow the <a class="link-button" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/">W3C Working Draft</a>
                for.
