            <p>
                <a class="link-button" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)">Cache</a>'s are
                used as a way to avoid repeating work that has already been done – in this case,
                downloading your CSS or JS files. On the web, browsers implement client-side caching through
                the use of <a class="link-button" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETag</a>
                and the more recent
                <a class="link-button" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control">Cache-Control</a>
                headers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most static file servers, such as Nginx, will provide ETag caching out-of-the-box, with
                no changes required. However, they will not automatically return Cache-Control headers,
                and for good reason. ETag caching requires that the client verify their cache is up-to-date
                before using it, via a
                <a class="link-button" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304">304 Not
                    Modified</a>
                response. This means that clients will, in theory, get the benefits of caching while always
                showing the most up-to-date file. On the contrary, Cache-Control headers may signal to the client
                to not verify the cache is up-to-date before using it, meaning that the behavior of the clients
                with cache-control headers may differ than from if they were not there at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although such behavior from Cache-Control seems undesirable, it
                can significantly reduce the load on the server and increase the
                perceived loading speed of the site. This is because for small
                files, it often takes almost the same amount of time to ask the
                server if it's valid as it would have to download the file –
                defeating the point of the cache!
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, for static files, it is possible to get most of the
                benefits of Cache-Control while still providing the guarrantees
                of ETag with only a <em>very</em> minor overhead. HTML files can
                be served with ETag caching (or weak Cache-Control settings such
                as <code class="text-monospace">must-revalidate</code>) to ensure the client has the
                most up-to-date version. However, all subresources are specified
                in the HTML file, and hence we can tell the client whether they
                are up to date on those without an individual request per
                subresource!
            </p>
            <p>
                This is achieved by noting that browsers include the query parameters
                in the cache, so Vanilla Plus JS injects a query parameter everywhere
                you import a file which changes when that file changes. Thus even if
                using strong cache-control settings (even <code class="text-monospace">immutable</code>),
                the client will still download the file if it is not up-to-date. This
                requires <strong>no source code changes</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, to take advantage of this, the static file server must
                provide the appropriate cache-control headers. The simplest setup
                would simply have all svgs, css, and js files be served with
                <code class="text-monospace">Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800, immutable</code>.
                If you wanted to be a bit more careful, ensure that the files are
                being accessed with the query parameters <code class="text-monospace">v</code>
                and <code class="text-monospace">pv</code> (for version and processor
                version) in that order.
