            <p>
                <a class="link-button" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_expansion">Inline expansion</a>, or
                inlining, generally refers to merging two different pieces of source code into a single
                location for performance. A much less common technique is called outlining, where
                a single piece of source code is split into multiple pieces. Vanilla Plus JS will extract
                any script or style tags within your HTML files and move them into their own file
                automatically. Furthermore, any SVGs which are included in your CSS files will be
                extracted into their own file automatically. Hence, Vanilla Plus JS will <em>outline</em>
                CSS, JS, and SVG files.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although there is an argument this could improve average performance when combined
                with the <a class="link-button" href="/cache_busting.html">cache</a> strategy
                discussed earlier, that is not the primary reason for this outlining.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <a class="link-button" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">Content Security
                    Policy</a>,
                or CSP, is a modern technique to mitigate many common threats to web applications.
                Though the developer cannot ignore these threats altogether, a strong CSP
                lowers the threat surface and thus how much the developer needs to be concerned
                about. A good basis for such a CSP is:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="text-monospace">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; object-src 'none';</code></pre>
            <p>
                This essentially states that the browser should not connect to any other
                websites than the one serving the HTML file, and should not run any scripts
                or images unless the server explicitly marks them as such. Furthermore, it
                prevents the use of <a class="link-button" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/object">&lt;object&gt;</a>,
                <a class="link-button" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/embed">&lt;embed&gt;</a>,
                and <a class="link-button" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/applet">&lt;applet&gt;</a>
                elements. This means that, short of writing scripts that are served directly
                by your static web server with an executable
                <a class="link-button" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME_type">MIME type</a>,
                which is a very unlikely scenario, the only scripts that will run on the browser
                are those you wrote: preventing
                <a class="link-button" href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting">cross-site
                    scripting</a>
                even if you would have otherwise been vulnerable.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most important parts of a CSP is preventing inline
                scripts, followed by inline styles and inline SVGs. That is
                because these are the most straight-forward ways to exploit
                unsanitized user input being displayed on the browser: a common
                mistake which often goes unnoticed. However, without additional
                tooling, this can lead to a worse developer experience, as it
                is often convenient to use inline styles and scripts for one-off
                behavior or for prototyping. Furthermore, these are often provided
                in online examples or the documentation for how to integrate
                libraries (most commonly analytics libraries). Even more difficult
                to manage, minified CSS files typically have SVGs inlined to make
                distribution simpler.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fortunately, with Vanilla Plus JS you can still use a strong CSP
                without changing your use of inline scripts and styles, as it will
                automatically extract them into their own files and replace the
                original inline tags with a link to the extracted file.
